VBA Homework
Rita Schaps-Franke

This is my first attempt at writing VBA script and although it was educational, it was also very frustrating. 
I tried several iterations of script to obtain the Total Stock Volume data but I just couldn't get the data to populate in the output table.
I finally surrendered and let it go, as well as the Calculated Values section. I need much more practice but I gave it my best.
I'm not sure what was expected of us to enter in this Read Me but like everything else in this class, it's my first experience with computer sciences.
